# Safe Space Monitor - README.md

## Overview

Safe Space Monitor is a real-time sensory regulation assistant designed for neurodiverse children. The application monitors environmental conditions (noise, light, and motion) and provides dual interfaces: a simplified child view with emoji-based status indicators and a detailed caregiver view with numerical data and historical charts. The system uses AI-powered predictions to detect sensory overload risks with 93.3% accuracy.

## User Preferences

Preferred communication style: Simple, everyday language with clear visual feedback.
