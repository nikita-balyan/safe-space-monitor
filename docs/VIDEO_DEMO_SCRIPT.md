## üìù FULL SCRIPT

### [0:00-1:00] INTRODUCTION - The Problem & Solution

**[VISUAL: Calming intro with project logo, then quick cuts showing sensory overload scenarios]**

**NARRATOR:**
"Imagine being a child in a world where everyday sounds feel like explosions, lights like laser beams, and movements like earthquakes. This is the reality for 75-96% of autistic children who experience sensory processing challenges."

**[VISUAL: Statistics overlay]**
- 75-96% of autistic children experience sensory challenges
- Current solutions: Reactive, not proactive
- Gap: No real-time monitoring exists

**NARRATOR:**
"Today, we're introducing Safe Space Monitor - an AI-powered system that detects sensory overload risk in real-time, providing early interventions before meltdowns occur."

### [1:00-3:00] LIVE DEMONSTRATION - System in Action

**[VISUAL: Switch to live application screen recording]**

**NARRATOR:**
"Let me show you how it works. Here's our live dashboard monitoring environmental conditions in real-time."

**[DEMO: Navigate through dashboard]**
- "You can see our three primary sensors: noise levels, light intensity, and motion activity"
- "The system processes this data continuously, updating every second"
- "Notice the AI probability indicator - currently showing low risk at 23%"

**[DEMO: Simulate overload scenario]**
- "Now, let's simulate a challenging environment..."
- "Watch as noise levels increase... light intensity spikes..."
- "The AI model immediately detects the pattern - overload probability jumps to 87%!"
- **Color changes from green to red with alert sound**

**NARRATOR:**
"At this critical moment, our recommendation engine springs into action."

**[DEMO: Show recommendations]**
- "For the child: Simple, calming suggestions with emojis üòä"
- "For the caregiver: Detailed strategies with success rates"
- "Evidence-based interventions like noise-cancelling headphones, quiet space suggestions, breathing exercises"

**[DEMO: Show feedback system]**
- "Caregivers can rate strategies - teaching the AI what works best for this specific child"
- "Over time, the system becomes increasingly personalized"

### [3:00-4:00] TECHNICAL HIGHLIGHTS - The AI Engine

**[VISUAL: Switch to technical diagrams and metrics]**

**NARRATOR:**
"Behind this simple interface lies sophisticated AI technology designed specifically for clinical applications."

**[VISUAL: Model performance metrics overlay]**
- "Our Enhanced Random Forest model achieves 93.3% accuracy"
- "That's significantly above our 85% target"
- "More importantly, we achieve 94.8% recall - meaning we rarely miss actual overload events"

**[VISUAL: Confusion matrix and ROC curve]**
- "The model demonstrates excellent discriminatory power"
- "Feature analysis shows noise is the primary trigger at 45% importance"
- "Response time under 100ms enables true real-time intervention"

**NARRATOR:**
"We chose Random Forest specifically for its interpretability - healthcare providers can understand why the system makes certain recommendations, building trust in the AI."

### [4:00-5:00] CLINICAL IMPACT & FUTURE

**[VISUAL: Return to application, show historical data]**

**NARRATOR:**
"But technology is only valuable if it creates real impact. Let's look at what this enables."

**[DEMO: Show historical tracking]**
- "Caregivers can track patterns over time - identifying triggers and successful interventions"
- "Export professional reports for healthcare providers"
- "Data-driven insights that were previously impossible to capture"

**NARRATOR:**
"This represents a fundamental shift from reactive crisis management to proactive, personalized support."

**[VISUAL: Future roadmap overlay]**
**NEAR-TERM (3-6 months):**
- Real sensor integration with wearable devices
- Clinical validation studies
- Mobile application development

**LONG-TERM (6-12 months):**
- Multi-modal AI with computer vision
- Integration with healthcare systems
- Expansion to other neurodiverse conditions

**[VISUAL: Closing shot with key message]**

**NARRATOR:**
"Safe Space Monitor demonstrates how AI, when thoughtfully designed with psychological principles at its core, can transform the lives of neurodiverse children and their families. This isn't just technology - it's empathy, understanding, and support, powered by intelligence."

**[FINAL VISUAL: Project logo with contact information]**
"Thank you for watching. Together, we're creating safer spaces for every child."
