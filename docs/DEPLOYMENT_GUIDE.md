# Deployment Guide - Safe Space Monitor

## 🚀 Live Deployment

**URL**: https://safe-space-monitor.onrender.com

## 📋 Deployment Status

- ✅ **Application**: Successfully deployed on Render
- ✅ **Health Checks**: Passing (`/health` endpoint)
- ✅ **Core Features**: Working (sensor simulation, predictions, recommendations)
- ⚠️ **AI Model**: Using simplified version for stable deployment

## 🛠️ Deployment Configuration

### Render Settings
- **Build Command**: `pip install -r requirements.txt`
- **Start Command**: `gunicorn deploy_app:app --bind 0.0.0.0:$PORT --workers 2`
- **Health Check Path**: `/health`
- **Environment**: Python 3.11.0

### Environment Variables
- `PORT=10000`
- `PYTHON_VERSION=3.11.0`

## 🔧 Troubleshooting

### Common Issues & Solutions:

1. **Model Loading Errors**
   - Solution: Using simplified prediction system for deployment
   - Fallback: Threshold-based predictions instead of ML model

2. **Memory Limitations** 
   - Solution: Lightweight dependencies in requirements.txt
   - Optimization: Minimal app structure for deployment

3. **Build Failures**
   - Solution: Pre-tested requirements.txt versions
   - Fallback: Simplified app structure
